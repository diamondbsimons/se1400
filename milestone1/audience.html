        <h2>Competition Analysis:</h2>

        <h4>What are competitors doing right?</h4>
        <p>Vrbo and Booking.com have well-organized property listings with high-quality images and detailed descriptions. They offer strong search filters and location-based recommendations, helping people find properties that meet their needs quickly.</p>

        <h4>What are competitors doing wrong?</h4>
        <p>Some competitors focus heavily on large vacation homes, which may not appeal to students or couples looking for more affordable, smaller accommodations. Housing is not as affordable for broke college students so we are trying to improve and help people get better housing options.</p>

        <h4>How can we do it better?</h4>
        <p>By tailoring our website specifically for students and couples, we can offer a more personalized experience, focusing on affordability, proximity to schools or work, and offering special discounts for long-term stays. Our website can also highlight local conveniences like public transport and community activities, which are often overlooked by larger competitors.</p>
